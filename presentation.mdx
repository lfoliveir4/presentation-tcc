# Agile software development

---

# Concept

Agile software development describes an approach to **software development** under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of **self-organizing** and **cross-functional** teams and their **customer(s)/end user(s)**.
It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

# Overview

- Iterative, incremental and evolutionary
- Efficient and face-to-face communication
- Very short feedback loop and adaptation cycle
- Quality focus

---

# The Manifesto

- **Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to Change** over following a plan

# Principles

1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
3. Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
